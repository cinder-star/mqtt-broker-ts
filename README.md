# MQTT broker TS

This is a simple implementation for an MQTT broker in Typescript. Feel free to clone the code and explore. ;)

## Installations and setup

- Firstly, install the dependenicies using `yarn`

```bash
    yarn
```

- Lastly, copy the `.example.env` and put your own port number

```bash
    cp .example.env .env
```

## Running the code

- Use yarn script to run the broker

```bash
    yarn dev
```

- You can test out the code by using this [tool](http://mqtt-explorer.com) or any other mqtt client.
